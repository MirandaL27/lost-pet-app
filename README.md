### About App:
Have you recently lost a pet? Lets work together as a community to bring lost pets home. Create a log in page where you can post about your lost pet with details & a picture of your loved family member. Once logged in, you can view the newsfeed to see the most recently posted lost animals. Members can comment on posts to work together to find the lost pet. Once the pet is located and brought home, edit the post to mark the pet as 'reunited'!
